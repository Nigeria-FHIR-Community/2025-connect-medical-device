### Purpose

This Implementation Guide (IG) provides a standards-based framework for testing interoperability between medical devices and health information systems using HL7 FHIR. It aims to ensure consistent communication of data such as measurements, calibration tasks, and operational status across device vendors and health platforms. The IG supports both real-time and batch-based device data exchange to facilitate integration in clinical and laboratory settings.

### Background

Medical devices such as chemistry analyzers, ventilators, and infusion pumps are critical to modern healthcare but often operate in silos. Lack of interoperability leads to inefficiencies in data collection, reporting, and clinical decision-making. HL7 FHIR offers a modern, flexible way to standardize device data exchange, enabling seamless integration with electronic health records (EHRs), laboratory systems, and monitoring dashboards. This guide builds on global best practices while aligning with Nigeriaâ€™s digital health interoperability priorities.

###  Scope of the FHIR Implementation Guide

This IG focuses on defining FHIR profiles and interactions relevant to the registration, monitoring, calibration, data reporting, and task execution of medical devices. It targets device manufacturers, software vendors, healthcare providers, and regulators who need to test, certify, or validate device interfaces. While the guide supports multiple device categories, the initial scope emphasizes laboratory analyzers and bedside monitors used in tertiary and secondary care settings. Members, get ideas from this [DevDays guide](https://www.devdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/uoyjk_201119_StefanSchlichting_DevicesOnFHIR.pdf) and [IHE](https://www.devdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Todd-Cooper-Devices-_-DevDays-2019-Amsterdam-1.pdf).

<!-- The scope of this guide focuses on the following core components:
- **Standardizing how immunization clients (patients) are registered and managed**, using the [**NgImmPatient**](StructureDefinition-NgImmPatient.html) profile.
- **Structuring immunization service delivery records**, such as vaccine administration, using the [**NgImmImmunization**](StructureDefinition-NgImmImmunization.html) profile.
- **Defining the necessary search parameters, RESTful operations, and data constraints** to ensure interoperable exchange of immunization data across digital platforms.
- **Providing the minimum data structures required** for systems to exchange immunization-related data across multiple levels of the health system, from point-of-care to national dashboards. -->

#### Use cases covered in this guide
The IG covers the following key use cases (which will continue to expand in subsequent iterations) by the Nigeria FHIR community:

- Device Registration: Standardized onboarding of medical devices into digital health platforms.
- Device Task Execution: Issuing and tracking commands like calibration or diagnostics.
- Device Observation & Monitoring: Reporting vital signs or test results in real-time.
- Audit and Provenance Tracking: Capturing access logs and change history for device-generated data.
- Device-Driven Alerts: Enabling downstream systems to act on status changes or anomalies from devices.
